## Introduction

Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) are a significant healthcare challenge, often leading to severe complications such as infections and ischemia, which may necessitate limb amputation or result in mortality. Accurate and prompt diagnosis of ulcer regions is crucial for preventing these outcomes. Manual examination of DFUs is labor-intensive and subject to variability. To address these challenges, we present **DFUC_CAM**, a novel method for instance segmentation of DFUs leveraging self-supervised learning.

**DFUC_CAM** employs a multi-stage methodology:
1. **Class Activation Maps (CAMs)**: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained for classification to generate CAMs that localize and highlight discriminative regions within DFU images.
2. **Self-Supervised Learning Framework**: Uses CAMs as pseudo labels to train a segmentation network.
3. **Segmentation Heads**: Fine-tunes three different segmentation heads to optimize DFU segmentation performance.

Our approach demonstrates significant potential in enhancing diabetic foot ulcer detection and segmentation in clinical settings.

## Features

- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Reduces reliance on large labeled datasets by learning from unlabeled data.
- **Class Activation Maps (CAMs)**: Provides interpretable localization of ulcer regions.
- **Multi-Stage Segmentation**: Combines classification, self-supervised pretraining, and fine-tuning for robust segmentation.
- **Flexible Segmentation Heads**: Supports Linear, CNN, and UNet segmentation heads for diverse requirements.
- **Dataset Augmentation**: Expands the training dataset through intelligent cropping and extensive augmentation.

## Methodology

### 1. CAM generation

- **Objective**: Convert a global classification task into a weakly supervised localization problem.
- **Approach**:
  - Train a binary classification network using **RepLKNet** to differentiate between ulcer and non-ulcer images.
  - Generate Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to highlight discriminative ulcer regions.
  - Utilize CAMs as pseudo labels for subsequent training stages.

### 2. Self-Supervised Learning

- **Objective**: Enhance the networkâ€™s feature representations without additional manual annotations.
- **Approach**:
  - Adapt the **Masked AutoEncoders (MAE)** architecture for ulcer detection.
  - Expand the training dataset from 4,000 to 360,000 images using CAM-based intelligent cropping.
  - Apply extensive augmentations (e.g., motion blur, color adjustments) to increase dataset variety and robustness.

### 3. Fine-tuning for Segmentation

- **Objective**: Achieve precise DFU segmentation using specialized segmentation heads.
- **Approach**:
  - **Linear Head**: Predicts low-resolution segmentation maps.
  - **CNN Head**: Recovers detailed spatial information with convolutional layers.
  - **UNet Head**: Utilizes a U-shaped architecture for multi-scale feature processing and precise pixel-wise segmentation.
